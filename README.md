# Real-Time Audio Spectrum Analyzer

A real-time audio analysis tool built in Python that visualizes microphone input in the time domain, frequency domain, and spectrogram, with interactive digital signal processing (DSP) filters.

This project was built to explore practical signal processing concepts such as FFT-based analysis, frequency-domain filtering, and real-time audio pipelines.

| `h` | Toggle high-pass filter |
| `b` | Toggle band-pass filter (≈300–3400 Hz) |
| `n` | Toggle notch filter |
| `[` | Move notch center frequency left |
| `]` | Move notch center frequency right |
| `-` | Narrow notch width |
| `=` | Widen notch width |
| `r` | Save last few seconds of audio + snapshot |

## Filters Explained

### Low-Pass Filter
Removes high-frequency content above a cutoff frequency. Useful for eliminating hiss or high-frequency noise.

### High-Pass Filter
Removes low-frequency content below a cutoff frequency. Useful for removing rumble or DC offset.

### Band-Pass Filter
Keeps only a middle range of frequencies (approximately human speech range). Commonly used in communications and voice processing.

### Notch Filter
Removes a very narrow band of frequencies (e.g., 60 Hz power-line hum) while leaving the rest of the signal intact. The notch frequency and width are adjustable in real time.

## Loudness Meter

The loudness meter displays signal level in **dBFS (decibels relative to full scale)**, computed from the RMS value of the audio signal.  
This provides a real-time indication of signal strength.

## Technical Details

- Audio input handled using `sounddevice.InputStream` with a callback-based pipeline
- FFT computed using NumPy (`np.fft.rfft`)
- Frequency-domain filtering implemented via magnitude masking
- Spectrogram generated by accumulating FFT frames over time
- Visualization built with Matplotlib
